## Package Validation

### Weight Limits

```yaml
limits:
  USPS: 70 lbs
  UPS: 150 lbs
  FedEx: 150 lbs

errors:
  overWeight: Package exceeds carrier weight limit
  action: Split into multiple packages or deny
```

### Dimension Limits

**Girth Calculation:**
```yaml
girth: length + 2 × (width + height)

example:
  length: 20 inches
  width: 15 inches
  height: 10 inches
  girth: 20 + 2×(15+10) = 70 inches

limits:
  USPS: 130 inches (length + girth)
  UPS: 165 inches
  FedEx: 165 inches
```

**Oversized Surcharge:**
```yaml
oversized:
  condition: length > 48 OR girth > 105
  surcharge: $75 - $150 depending on carrier
```

## Dimensional Weight

### DIM Weight Calculation

**Formula:**
```yaml
dimWeight: (length × width × height) / dimDivisor

dimDivisors:
  domestic: 139
  international: 166

example:
  dimensions: 20 × 15 × 10 inches
  volume: 3000 cubic inches
  dimWeight: 3000 / 139 = 21.6 lbs

actualWeight: 15 lbs
billableWeight: 21.6 lbs (higher of actual vs DIM)
```

### Multi-Package Optimization

```yaml
scenario:
  items: 50 lbs total
  options:
    - singlePackage:
        weight: 50 lbs
        cost: $45

    - twoPackages:
        package1: 25 lbs → $25
        package2: 25 lbs → $25
        total: $50

selection: Single package (cheaper)
```
